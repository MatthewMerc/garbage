This one is just a metaphor.

I do not want to leave this house.

This house has people in it.

The people in this house are LingLing, Me, and my Wife, Jo-An Darc Mercado-Chen

We must leave this house soon.

Why must we leave this house soon?

According to Lacanian Psychoanalysis, there a three fundamental human registers.

These registers pre-date human existence and exist on "the other side.".

--The Symbolic, the world of language, mapping the imaginary into structurual webs of meaning.

--The Real, Ã¸

Do not stop writing do not stop writing do not stop writing even though your body may be on fire you must never stop writing

The house is on fire?

This house has people in it.

The unconcious itself is a subset of the symbolic order, where symbols defer to other symbols creating thought

The imaginary is the ceramic

The real is the hammer that breaks the ceramic

The symbolic is the gold leaf that binds the ceramic together again. A kintsugi universe.
